#IMPORTANT ERROR RELATED
In Python, errors are printed first and the output is shown later because errors and normal output are written to
different “files”. Errors are written to “standard error” (stderr) and normal output is written to
“standard output” (stdout). This behavior happens because stdout is buffered and stderr is not, for performance reasons.
It means that there can be delay when you write something on stdout (print instruction) but not when an error is written
on stderr, hence resulting in standard output writing occurring after standard error .
